# Metro_Lobbysystem
A simple Minecraft Lobby-System (out of support)

there are components from an LobbySystem created by ManuGun (LocationManager and ItemManager) and DerBank (Scoreboard).
His Lobby-System: https://github.com/ManuGun/LobbySystem

His Scoreboard: https://github.com/DerBanko/TutorialReloaded/tree/master/src/main/java/tv/banko/tutorialreloaded/scoreboard
His Github: https://github.com/DerBanko/



Note: not all components are clearly working, i am sorry (in my opinion it's only the JumpPadListener), it was my first Minecraft plugin.
